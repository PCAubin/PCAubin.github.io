I joined as postdoc the VADOR team at TU Wien with Aris Daniilidis for 23/24.\nFrom September 2021 to August 2023, I was a post-doctoral researcher at INRIA SIERRA, working with Alessandro Rudi. I obtained my PhD in July 2021 from PSL MINES ParisTech (Paris), at the CAS laboratory, working on shape/state constraints in optimal control and nonparametric regression through kernel methods (manuscript, slides). I graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with Jean-Philippe Vert (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).\nI am interested in the links between kernel methods, optimal control, Kalman filtering and optimization in measure spaces. So far I have shown that kernels appear in linear-quadratic optimal control because of Hilbertian vector spaces of trajectories, while, for estimation problems, they appear through covariances of Gaussian processes. It is this dual, deterministic and stochastic, nature of kernels which underlies the duality between optimal control and estimation in the Linear-Quadratic case. Kernels even extend to mean-field control article\nMy latest focus is on optimization problems where the distance is replaced by a generic cost function (article). The natural algorithm here is alternating minimization for which we gave novel rates with Flavien Léger. I also study sign-reversing involutions on max-plus spaces with Stéphane Gaubert.\nMy research and my lyricomania, a passion I share within the association Juvenilia, do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly paint.\n\rContact: pierre-cyril[dot]aubin(at)inria[dot]fr\r[comment]: ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://pcaubin.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"News   If you want an overview of some of my research up to July 2023 concerning optimization and kernels, here are some slides\n  New article with Alain Bensoussan, on the RKHSs of push-forward maps for mean-field control,\n  New article with Flavien Léger, on alternating minimization and gradient descent with a general cost, slides\n  New article in Pure and Applied Functional Analysis, with Alain Bensoussan, on the RKHSs of Kalman filtering,","tags":null,"title":"Pierre-Cyril Aubin-Frankowski","type":"authors"}]
