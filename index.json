I obtained my PhD in July 2021 from PSL MINES ParisTech (Paris), at the CAS laboratory, working on shape/state constraints in optimal control and nonparametric regression through kernel methods. The manuscript can be found here, the slides are here. I graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with Jean-Philippe Vert (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).\nI am interested in the links between kernel methods, optimal control, Kalman filtering and optimization in measure spaces. So far I have shown that kernels appear in linear-quadratic optimal control because of Hilbertian vector spaces of trajectories, while, for estimation problems, they appear through covariances of Gaussian processes. It is this dual, deterministic and stochastic, nature of kernels which underlies the duality between optimal control and estimation in the Linear-Quadratic case.\nMy research and my lyricomania, a passion I share within the association Juvenilia, do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly paint.\n\rContact: pierre-cyril[dot]aubin(at)inria[dot]fr","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://pcaubin.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"New article in Pure and Applied Functional Analysis, with Alain Bensoussan, on the RKHSs of Kalman filtering,\n  New article at NeurIPS22, with Anna Korba and Flavien Léger, on Mirror Descent with Relative Smoothness in Measure Spaces, with application to Sinkhorn and EM,\n  New article, with Stéphane Gaubert, on the tropical analogues of reproducing kernels with applications to value functions,\n  Since September 2021, I am a post-doctoral researcher at INRIA SIERRA, working with Alessandro Rudi.","tags":null,"title":"Pierre-Cyril Aubin-Frankowski","type":"authors"}]
