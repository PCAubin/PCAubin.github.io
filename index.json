It is a matrix-valued reproducing kernel, instrumental in Linear-Quadratic optimal control, related to the Gramian of controllability and to the dual Riccati equation (see pdf for an introduction and pdf for the application to state constraints).\nI have also developped a general, convex and modular framework to handle shape constraints in RKHSs (see pdf), applied for instance to trajectory reconstruction. This is a line of work, originally inspired by non-crossing quantile regression, with Zoltán Szabó, motivated by econometrics and finance studies.\nI graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with Jean-Philippe Vert (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).\nMy PhD and my lyricomania do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly paint.\n\rContact: pierre-cyril[dot]aubin(at)mines-paristech[dot]fr","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://pcaubin.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Since September 2018, I am a Ph.D. student at the CAS laboratory at MINES ParisTech (Paris), advised by Nicolas Petit, working on shape/state constraints in optimal control and nonparametric regression through kernel methods.
