This revolves around optimization problems in infinite dimensions with infinitely many constraints. I am interested in the near future in studying connections between kernels and dynamical constrained/controlled systems, among which measures, continuity equations (see ICML21) and structured learning problems.\nDuring my PhD, I defined a new positive definite kernel, dubbed the Linear-Quadratic kernel. It is a matrix-valued reproducing kernel, instrumental in Linear-Quadratic optimal control, related to the Gramian of controllability and to the dual Riccati equation (see pdf for an introduction, pdf for the application to state constraints, arxiv with Alain Bensoussan for a general formula extended to PDE control).\nI have also developped a general, convex and modular framework to handle shape constraints in RKHSs (see pdf), applied for instance to trajectory reconstruction (see NeuriPS 2020 video for a quick overview in 180s). This is a line of work, originally inspired by non-crossing quantile regression, with Zoltán Szabó. We were particularly motivated by econometrics and finance studies.\nI graduated from École polytechnique (X2013) in 2017, then obtained my Master degree (MVA, Mathematics-Vision-Learning) with Highest Honours after an internship with Jean-Philippe Vert (CBIO-Google) on gene network inference (based on single-cell RNA sequencing).\nMy research and my lyricomania, a passion I share within the association Juvenilia, do not leave me so much time to spare, but I occasionnaly paint.\n\rContact: pierre-cyril[dot]aubin(at)inria[dot]fr","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://pcaubin.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"News: New article, with Stéphane Gaubert, on the tropical analogues of reproducing kernels with applications to value functions, check it out\nSince September 2021, I am a post-doctoral researcher at INRIA SIERRA, working with Alessandro Rudi.\nI defended my PhD in July 2021.
